Maintain "minPrice" and "maxProfit"
During the price list scan, update minPice, and maxProfit (current profix is prices[i] - minPrice) as well
Idea is - minPrice will potentially lead to maxProfit, but maxProfit not necessary base on minPrice because highest
price could happened before the minPrice appear.

Pay attention to empty price list.
